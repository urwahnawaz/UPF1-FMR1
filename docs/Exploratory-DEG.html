The results in this page were generated with repository version
<a href="https://github.com/unawaz1996/UPF1-FMR1/tree/82cea366c520277be7fb7f17e2ca0985a7c050f2" target="_blank">82cea36</a>.
See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made
to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .Rproj.user/
    Ignored:    analysis/Exploratory-DEG.nb.html
    Ignored:    analysis/Quality-control.nb.html
    Ignored:    data/lists/

Untracked files:
    Untracked:  data/upf3b-patients.xlsx

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not
included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to
have uncommitted changes.

<h3>Overlap between FRAX and UPF1 genes</h3>
<p>Using the DEGs from limma pipeline, I performed a correlation
analysis of FRAX DEGs with UPF1 DEGs, with respect to their relative log
2 fold change. Overall, a strong correlation (r = 0.95) was observed for
this analysis</p>

taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
